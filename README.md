# Bayesian-RRS-Models
This Repository contains some of the Bayesian Non Parametric Models Based on variational inference using Russian Roulette Sampling Method of approximating an infinite sum.

**The papers reffered are mentioned here :**

Note : optimizer.py is taken from pytorch default library and is used for implementing dynamic version Adam optimizer for stochastic gumbel-softmax layers

APIC Net is a Bayesian Nueral Network modelling currently being developed using RRS VI.
